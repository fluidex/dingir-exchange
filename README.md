$ cd docker
$ docker-compose up # Lanuch the external dependency services like Postgresql and Kafka
$ cd $DingirExchangeDir
$ cargo run --bin matchengine # or `make startall` to start all services
$ cd $DingirExchangeDir/examples/js ; npm i

## Release

We uses [cross](https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross) to generate release builds for Linux Distributions.
For example, you could generate a static release build via the below command.

```
cross build --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --release
```

And a new Docker image could be generated by the `release` script.

```
# In root directory of this project
./release/release.sh YOUR_DOCKER_REGISTRY_DOMAIN.COM:YOUR_DOMAIN_PORT NEW_IMAGE_TAG
```
